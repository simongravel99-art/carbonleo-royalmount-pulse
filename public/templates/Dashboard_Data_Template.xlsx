# Dashboard Data Template

This Excel template file would normally be created using a spreadsheet application. Instead, I'll create the structure documentation and CSV templates that can be easily converted to Excel format.

The template should contain the following worksheets:
1. Overview - KPI data and market share
2. Finance - Financial metrics and NOI data  
3. Sales - Tenant sales and category performance
4. Traffic - Visitor traffic and market share
5. Operations - Energy, maintenance, and safety data
6. GuestExperience - NPS, satisfaction, and service metrics
7. CleaningQuality - CQS scores and area performance

Each worksheet includes:
- Data validation rules
- Conditional formatting
- Example data rows
- Input instructions
- Automatic calculations where appropriate
